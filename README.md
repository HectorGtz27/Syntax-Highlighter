# Lexical Analyzer Project

## Overview

This project is a sophisticated lexical analyzer implemented in C++ designed to process and enhance source code files written in C, Python, and Racket. The primary feature of this analyzer is its ability to highlight syntax by accurately identifying various token types such as keywords, literals, identifiers, operators, and special characters. The analyzer generates HTML outputs that visually differentiate these token types, improving code readability and analysis.

## Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Accurately identifies and highlights keywords, literals, identifiers, operators, and special characters.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Processes source code written in C, Python, and Racket.
- **HTML Output**: Generates HTML files that visually differentiate token types for better readability.
- **S-Expressions to Regex**: Converts structured S-expressions into regular expressions.
- **Escaping Special Characters**: Ensures proper escaping of special characters in strings.

## Skills Demonstrated

- C++ Programming
- Lexical Analysis
- Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Syntax Highlighting
- Multi-Language Support
- HTML/CSS for generating styled output
- Software Development and Code Quality Tools
- Problem Solving and Attention to Detail

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lexical-analyzer.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd lexical-analyzer
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   ```sh
   make
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Input File**: Place your source code file in the project directory. For example, `examples.txt`.

2. **Run the Analyzer**:
   ```sh
   ./lexical-analyzer examples.txt
   ```

3. **View the Output**: Open the generated `output.html` in your web browser to see the highlighted syntax.

## File Structure

- **main.cpp**: Controls the main program flow, defines regex patterns, and generates HTML output.
- **Lexer.cpp/h**: Defines the `Token` structure and functions to remove comments, store tokens, and generate HTML output.
- **SExpr.cpp/h**: Defines the `SExpr` structure and functions to convert S-expressions to regular expressions.
- **RegexConverter.cpp/h**: Provides functions for escaping special characters and translating S-expressions to regular expressions.
- **examples.txt**: Sample input file containing source code.
- **output.html**: Example HTML output generated by the analyzer.
